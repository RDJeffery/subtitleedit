# SubtitleEdit Porting Plan to Avalonia UI

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan for porting SubtitleEdit from Windows Forms to Avalonia UI, making it cross-platform compatible with macOS and other platforms.

## Core Rules
1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep the existing core business logic intact
   - Only modify UI-related code
   - Maintain separation of concerns between UI and business logic
   - Follow MVVM pattern for new UI components

2. **Compatibility**
   - Ensure all existing features work on macOS
   - Maintain Windows compatibility
   - Handle platform-specific code appropriately
   - Use cross-platform APIs where possible

3. **Testing**
   - Test each ported component thoroughly
   - Verify functionality on both Windows and macOS
   - Maintain existing test coverage
   - Add new tests for platform-specific features

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all major changes
   - Update existing documentation
   - Keep track of known issues and workarounds
   - Document platform-specific considerations
